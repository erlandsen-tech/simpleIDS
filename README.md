Simple intrusion detection system
1 first run Ids_hash.sh with config file in same dir
2 to check if anything has changed run Ids_compare.sh with previous hash in same directory
3 Any changed file will be printed to shell

### Future
* Implement pgp encryption for hashSum
* Take arbitrary file as config
* Take arbitrary file as hashsum
